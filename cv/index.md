An **Heartfelt** person is a person who have passion for what he do, in tech is to have passion for emerging technologies and "living on the edge" of the new things that came up not limited to the few which one *has to* work on.

Be a **polyglot** means to not stagnate in a particular language or paradigm, every one has his purpose and use case, so know a few of them gives more tools to choose from. Being polyglot also lead to have avid curiosity about new languages and the need and will to have capacity in learning them.

A **tightrope walker** is a person who can push his knowledge to the limits in difficult situations. In real world  being a programmer isn't about coding at all, every monkey with a right education or self-reading of some technic book can code a *while loop*. Being a good **coder** you must have knowledge of a lot of aspects that are around coding itself like graphics, sysadmin and networking, copyrighting... and all of this must be mastered by a well sharpened  mind. In addition to this constructive aspect there's the destructive one: every programmer knows (or eventually will) that he will spend more time reading code rather than writing it, to take advantage of this, one has to use **hacker** like and reverese engeenering skills.

Through all this lines substitute the word 'programmer' with developer, software engineer, coder, software architect, wargods of the mighty developing... because they describes quite the same person, they're just titles. The harsh reality in my humble opinion is that there are programmers that are programmers and there are programmers that aren't programmer at all (the latter, sadly, being more numerous).
