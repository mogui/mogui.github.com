My girlfriend read me these lines from a book she is reading:

> ...In this book THE MEDUSA AND THE SNAIL., science writer Lewis Thomas said that english word ERROR developed from a root meaning "to wonder about , looking for something". 
> That's why he liked Darwin's idea that **error is the driving force in evolution**. 
> The capacity to blunder slightly is the real marvel of dna - said Thomas. "without this special attribute, we would still be anaerobic bacteria and there would be no music "

  
###error is the driving force in evolution

read from a developer perspective it confirms the famous statement "My code never has bugs, it just develops random feature"

my conclusion: 

### Software Bugs are random features towards evolution ###
