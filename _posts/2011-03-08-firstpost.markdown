*From something, somewhere we must start...*   
... and god save us from Hello World! ... and I'm not going to bore you and me with who I am 'cause no one cares (and it's written at the right side) I'll start describing what this blog will talk about and how, or at least which are my expectation about it and about me writing here...

The posts will be some in italian ( which is my language ), some in english based upon how I feel in that moment. Hope my english will be understandable to an english speaking, cause my english (and my italian too) sometimes <del>sucks</del> isn't so good.

The content will be related to my work, coding stuff, internet stuff, experiment, tests and the likes... I hope the most of them will be full-fledged extremely useful article solving some problem, but I don't know if I'm able do that, so along side with these masterpiece there will be also some ***simple link*** to something I consider interesting or ***quotes*** from someone who said something more interesting than I could do. 

At the same time I'll try to document and spur myself to bring forward my ***own-frozen-neverending projects*** and try to release soon or later.

I'll begin with an article about a little trick published for the blog of the
Team I still work with.

Hello World!
